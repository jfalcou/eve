# EVE - the Expressive Vector Engine

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/jfalcou/eve/tree/develop.svg?style=svg&circle-token=341ef01f38a05865882565127a64f692f650fc7b)](https://circleci.com/gh/jfalcou/eve/tree/develop)

## Purpose

EVE is a reimplementation of the old EVE SIMD library by Falcou et al. which for a while was
named Boost.SIMD. It's a C++20 and onward implementation of a type based wrapper around
SIMD extensions sets for most current architectures. It aims at showing how C++20 can be used
to design and implement efficient, low level, high abstraction library suited for high performances.

It's a research project first and an open source library second. We reserve the right to
change API and baseline compiler required until the first official 0.1 release. However, we'll try
to minimize disruption. Semantic versioning will ensure API retro-compatibility if anything huge
needs to change.

## What's left to do?

EVE is roughly usable at the moment but we need to:
 [ ]  Complete and host the documentations on the web
 [ ]  Implement algorithms à la std over SIMD-izable ranges
 [ ]  Complete implementations of some functions like multi-register shuffles and some math functions
 [ ] Fix potential performance or codegen issues

## FAQ

 - **Why C++20 ?** Becasue we want to be able to use modern design components like Concepts, and later on, Modules.
 - 
 - **Why this instead of std::simd or any other libraries?** EVE is a playground for testing proper
 design and implementation decision for such libraries. Vc and its standard version are fine pieces
 of work but we aim at pushing the envelop in term of API and implementation without any standard
 restriction. We will try, however, to keep up with standard naming as much as possible.

 - **Is this Boost.SIMD v42.69?** Yes and no. This reimplementation is based on slightly different
 premises and some radical new ideas. All results exhibited by all our previous Boost.SIMD papers
 still holds and we'll try to improve upon.

 - **I want to help!** Good, we need tests on exotic configuration, maybe a stable PPC test machines.
 Write code, make it fail so we can improve for use cases we may have missed. Fork and hack away.
