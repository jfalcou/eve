List of operations SIMD types need to support for the Octo-Tiger gravity kernels:

- Arithmethic:
+ - * / += -=

- Data:
copy_from
copy_to
[supporting element_aligned_tag{}]
construct from scalar (for example simd_t(1.0);)
size

- Masking:
< (mask = simd1 < simd2);)
any_of
choose ("where" also works)
&& (mask = mask1 && mask2)

- Functions:
sqrt
max
