Change Log {#changelog}
==========

## Version 2023.02.15

Codename: [Perdita Quiescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdita_(The_Winter%27s_Tale))

### What's Changed

#### Removal and Depreciation
  * The proba module as been removed. (See #1490) It will be reworked as a separate project later on with a proper API.

#### Architectures/Compilers Support & Fixes
##### The One Big News for this release: SVE

  * SVE with fixed size, power of 2 cardinal is now supported for most of our API. Some more optimizations are on the way but the support is functional. (See  #1432, #1435, #1436, #1437, #1438, #1448, #1453, #1455, #1456, #1463, #1464, #1472, #1473, #1474,#1487, #1489, #1491, #1494, #1533, #1556)

##### Other Fixes
  * **EVE** now compiles on ARM M1 with Homebrew g++. (See #1471)
  * **EVE** now compiles with Apple Clang (See #1479, #1485, #1502, #1530, #1531)
  * Various efforts have been made to advance the MSVC situation. Help still welcomed.
  * ARM all and any are now more efficient (See #1500)
  * Integral sign/signnz functions are now more efficient on x86 (See #1499)
  * Implementation for X86 AVX2/AVX512 gather and masked gather are now optimized. (See #1526)

#### Features
  * **jtlap** implemented a large amount of new functions for `eve::complex`.
  * Functions like exp, log or sqrt can now be called with a real entry and a complex output. (See #1528)
  * Binary functions for which a n-ary extensions is available now support being called with a tuple-like parameter instead of a dynamic range (See #1422, #1509)
  * The minmax function is now available. (See #1507)
  * **DenisYaroshevskiy** implemented new traits for algorithms to take care of costly kernels, no alignment and to support fused operations. (See #1535, #1543)

#### Bug Fixes
  * Convert is now more efficient and don't generate piecewise evaluation in some scenario involving logicals. (See #1447, #1428)
  * `if_else` now uses the proper constant generator in optimized cases. (See #1529)
  * Prevent constant to erroneously be callable with non-specific product types. (See #1540)
  * A large cleanup of old traits and concepts has been done. The basics concepts around vectorizable and vectorized types has been therefore simplified and streamlined. (See #1468, #1477, #1527, #1488, #1545)
  * Fix issue with dynamic SIMD extension detection that were broken by accident. (See #1504)
