The Expressive Vector Engine
============================

**EVE** is a new implementation of the previous **EVE** SIMD library by Falcou et al. which for a while was named Boost.SIMD. It's a C++20 and onward implementation of a type based wrapper around SIMD extensions sets for most current architectures. It aims at showing how C++20 can be used to design and implement efficient, low level, high abstraction library suited for high performances.

It's a research project first and an open source library second. We reserve the right to change API and baseline compiler required until the first official 0.1 release. However, we'll try to minimize disruption. Semantic versioning will ensure API retro-compatibility if anything huge needs to change.
