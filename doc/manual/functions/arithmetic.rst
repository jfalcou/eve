Arithmetic Functions
####################

These functions provide scalar and SIMD version of basic arithmetic functions
For most of those functions, their semantic are the same than for regular language operator
or functions with the one restriction that both parameters must share a type unless specified
otherwise. Note also that  operations are performed within the input type's range.
