## Initial problem

Let's say we want to convert back and forth between 2D cartesian coordinates and 2D polar coordinates.
This is a rather common exercise and will only require basic arithmetic and trigonometric functions.

Cartesian coordinates are usually represented by a pair of floating point values \f$(x,y)\f$.
In a similar way, polar coordinate can be represented as a pair \f$(\rho,\theta)\f$ where
\f$\rho\f$ represents the length of the ray and \f$\theta\f$ represents the angle with the X axis.

A bit of geometry in the unit circle leads to a relationship between the cartesian and the polar
coordinate :

Therefore, we can derive the following C++ functions that perform those conversions:

@snippet tutorial/intro-01.cpp scalar-function

As expected, the code only requires simple arithmetic operators and some trigonometric functions.

@note Fellow mathematicians in the audience may have some remarks on this code. For now, we will
deal with the fact that it requires \f$\theta\f$ to be in radians and that the accuracy of
computing \f$\rho\f$ this way is maybe sub-optimal. We will address those concerns in
[the 4th tutorial](@ref intro-04) of this series.

## From scalar to SIMD using eve::wide

The next step is to work a SIMD version of those function. When dealing with SIMD data types,
one has to remember that a single operation has to be performed on multiple value. There, we will
be working on multiple `x`and `y` along with multiple \f$\rho\f$ and \f$\theta\f$.

SIMD instructions sets provides architecture-specific types for SIMD register along with ISA
specific functions. Of course, handling such types and functions is highly non-portable. To
overcome this issue, **EVE** provides a generic, architecture agnostic type for SIMD computation:
`eve::wide`.

As **EVE** provides SIMD implementation of all basic operators and all the common math functions
(among others), the conversion from scalar to SIMD is done by:
  - including the proper header files
  - replacing `float` with `eve::wide<float>`
  - calling function from namespace `eve` instead of `std`.

The SIMD version of our convertion functions are then given by:

@snippet tutorial/intro-01.cpp simd-function

`eve::wide` behaves like a regular type and can just be dropped as a replacement for any C++
arithmetic types.

## Handling eve::wide and architecture impact

The remaining question is how to put data inside an instance of `eve::wide` so we can write tests
for our SIMD polar/cartesian conversion functions.

### Portable eve::wide definition
Let's start with the `to_polar` function:

@snippet tutorial/intro-01.cpp simd-test-polar

There, we construct two instances of `eve::wide` using two different constructors:

  - `x` is constructed from a single scalar value. The result is a register with a 4 in every lane.
  - `y` is constructed from a callable object taking two parameters. The first parameter is the
    current lane to compute, the second is the actual width of the register. The callable object is
    called once per lane with the corresponding lane index. Here, we use a lambda function that
    store `1.5 * (1 + i)` in the ith lane.

An important detail is to note that neither the `eve::wide` type nor any of those constructors
requires an *a priori* knowledge of the actual CPU architecture nor the actual number of lane
in the register. This architecture-agnostic style is the main advantage of **EVE** as it guarantees
the portability of the code.

Let's compile this small test using g++:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
g++ intro-01.cpp -O3 -DNDEBUG -I/path/to/eve
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, if you're compiling on a Intel X86_64 machine, the SSE2 SIMD extension set will be used
by the compiler. Under SSE2, SIMD register of `float` have four lanes. So the expected result is:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(4, 4, 4, 4) (1.5, 3, 4.5, 6)
(4.272, 5, 6.0208, 7.2111) (0.358771, 0.643501, 0.844154, 0.982794)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As expected, we got four values per register.

But what if we want to use a SIMD extension with larger registers, say AVX2 for example? In this
case, you need to pass the appropriate option to your compiler. For g++, this means using `-mavx2`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
g++ intro-01.cpp -O3 -DNDEBUG -mavx2 -I/path/to/eve
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As AVX2 registers are twice as big, the output should now contains 8 values:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4) (1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9, 10.5, 12)
(4.272, 5, 6.0208, 7.2111, 8.5, 9.84886, 11.2361, 12.6491) (0.358771, 0.643501, 0.844154, 0.982794, 1.08084, 1.15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As expected, **EVE** code scales naturally with the selected architecture at compile time.

### Specific eve::wide definition
Now, let's write a test for `to_cartesian` using some other constructors.

@snippet tutorial/intro-01.cpp simd-test-cartesian

Sometimes, you may want to use a fixed number of lanes instead of relying on the automatic register
scaling. This is done by forcing the width of a `eve::wide` using `eve::fixed`. In our test, we decide
to work with a 4 elements register. **EVE** portability will still apply as **EVE** will select the best
storage option for a given size on current architecture by reusing native register for small value of
`eve::fixed` or aggregating multiple registers in case of a very large value of `eve::fixed`.

We also introduce two new constructor:
  - `rho` is constructed from a pointer to `float`. This will trigger a memory-to-register transfer
    and read  `eve::wide<float>::size()` contiguous elements starting from `&data[2]`.
  - `theta` is constructed from the exact sequence of scalar values passed as argument. This constructor
    is less portable than the other as it requires to know the size of the register at construction time.

Be aware that, most of the time you want to defer to the automatic scaling capability of `eve::wide`.
The `eve::fixed` component is here to help those corner cases where a fixed size is required to
simplify the code you write.

## Conclusion
In this first tutorial, we managed to:
  - get familiar with eve::wide, the main SIMD enabling type from **EVE**
  - take a simple scalar operation and turn it into a SIMD function using eve::wide
  - compile the code for various platform and checks the results.
  - be aware of the automatic scaling vs the fixed size style of coding with `eve::wide`

[In the next tutorial](@ref intro-02), we will use this SIMD function as it should by applying it over multiple
data.
