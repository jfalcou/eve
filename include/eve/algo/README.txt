_NOTE_: This is a temporary documentation that is just very quick to write a modify. Will migrate later.

algo is for stl/ranges style algorithms using simd.

Main eve supports it's callables for scalars. We don't do that for algorithms. The code is still portable since the cpu emulation is enabled.

# Helpers

### iterator (concept)

*TODO*

Main models:
* `algined_ptr` with attached cardinal
* pointer with attached cardinal
* zip of `aligned_ptr` and pointer

The basic concept for writing algorithms against.

The minimum requirements are:
* `eve::load` or `eve::store` are defined (returned types are not restricted).
* `I::cardinal` is defined and is eve::fixed.
* `I += n`  // `n` is `std::ptrdiff_t` is divisible by `I::cardinal{}()`
* `I - I` - returns the distance between two iterators (in elements).
* I is totally ordered
* `I.unaligned()` - returns an `unaligned_iterator` pointing to the same place.
* `I.unaligned()` and `I` are comparible
* `I.previous_partially_aligned()` - returns our best attempt to align this iterator.

### aligned_iterator(concept)

*TODO*

The main model is `aligned_ptr_iterator`

This is a `partially_aligned_iterator` but has an extra feature: we can do `unsafe` load.
When we get to unbounded algorithms it will become important.

### partially_aligned_iterator(concept)

I and partially_aligned_t<I> are the same.

The main model is `aligned_ptr_iterator`, `zip_iterator<aligned_ptr_iterator, unaligned_ptr_iterator>`

Loading/Storign is more efficient than doing the same from `unaligned`. We can only step in `I::cardinal{}()` divisible steps.

### unaligned_iterator(concept)

I and unaligned_t<I> are the same.

The main model is `unaligned_ptr_iterator`

iterator that can represent any position in the underlying range.

### always_aligned_iterator (concept)

I is the same as `partially_aligned_t<I>` and `unaligned_t<I>`

Main model: iota_iterator.

These are not phisical iterators but rather some mechanisms that pretend to be iterators.
alignment does not matter to them, every position is just as efficient as any other.

### iteration patterns

*`for_each_iteration`

A reusable component to do `while(f != l) ++f;`.
Given traits, f, l, delegate calls the delegate for each piece with (f, ignore).
The specific api of the delegate varies by iteration pattern.

Main one is `for_each_iteration`.
However for some algorithms, like `reverse` and maybe `partition` it's not a good.

### range algorithm adaters

* `one_range_algorithm_adapter`

These are helpers to deal with all of the boilerplate of algorithm interfaces.
Get's from the ranges,std::contigious iterators, various eve iterators, default traits, provided traits etc
to something uniform that specific algorithms can actually use.

### traits

* `traits`
* `unroll`
* `no_aligning`
* `divisible_by_cardinal`

traits is a way to customise the behaviour of the algorithm.
Different algorithms support different customizations.

### concepts

* `unaligned_t` -> a convinience to get the unaligned type.
* `partially_aligned_t` -> a convinience to get the type of `previous_partially_aligned`
* `same_unaligned_iterator<T, U>` -> checks if two iterators have the same unaligned types.
* `iterator_basics` -> checks everything about iterator except for load and store
* `readable_iterator`
* `unaligned_iterator`
* `partially_aligned_iterator`
* `always_aligned_iterator`

### iterator helpers

* `operations_with_distance` -> provides boilerplate distance operations.
* `forward_to_unaligned` -> provides boilerplate operations using `unaligned()`

### array_utils

* `array_map`
* `array_reduce`

Functional style utilites to perform common operations on arrays.
For example, using `std::reduce` on a small array to compute a sum will no be efficient,
since it will generate instructions that can be executed in parallel.
`array_reduce` will.

### ptr_iterator

* `aligned_ptr_iterator`
* `unaligned_ptr_iterator`

A pointer + cardinal with the `iterator` interface.

### preprocess_range

* `preprocess_range`

Given a more general notion of a range + traits returns enhanced traits +
iterator/sentinel pair that is understood by eve.
This is one hand a helper for `range algorithm adapters` and on the other (*TODO*)
a customization point for different ranges that need some non-default handling.

### for_each_iteration

`for_each_iteration(traits, f, l)`

_TODO_: we need some way to know where the iteration pattern starts from before actually doing anything. Example is `remove` it needs the base of where to start writing and it has to be there at the time of delegate creation.

The basic iteration pattern. A simd version of `while (f != l)`.
Delegate needs to implement `step(iterator, relative_condtional_expr)` and
_TODO_ `step_unrolled(iterator)` if the `unroll` trait is bigger than 1.
`iterator` type from steps is not guarantied to match `decltype(f)` (for when we know we can align the input for example).

`step` returns `true` if it wants to break or `false` to continue.
