# Bits related Functions
These functions provide scalar and SIMD version of bit operations. Bitwise operations are extended
to work on any [value](../concepts.html#value) types by considering the masking operations to apply
on the value bit patterns while retaining its original types.

For the two parameters operations which are truly bitwise operation on the whole input datas
(i.e. excluding shifts) or for `bit_not`, there is no type nor cardinal restrictions between
operands of bitwise function as long as their size in bytes are equal. This implies calls of such
function on [real floating values](../concepts.html#concepts/convenienceconcepts/value-basedconvenienceconcepts)
are possible as long as they are performed with a second parameters of proper size.

The other single parameter operations, unless stated explicitly, are restricted to unsigned based values.

!!! WARNING
   Note that if a binary operator contains a negation as `bit_andnot`, the position of the negation
   matches the position of the parameter: for example, `bit_andnot(x,y)` is semantically equivalent to `bit_and(x,bit_not(y))`
   and often optimized.
