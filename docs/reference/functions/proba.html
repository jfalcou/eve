# Probability distribution Functions
These functions provide scalar and SIMD version of basic real probability distributions. To keep the
results homogeneous and coherent between SIMD and scalar mode, the types usable in those functions
are required to satisfy [`eve::compatible_values`](../concepts/compatible.html) and must be floating and real.

Each of the distributions bring a set of attributes.

Once created a distribution object can be called using a set of EVE object functions namely:

 - constant attributes:
   - parameters: parameters stored in the object (always defined)
   - mean: expectation
   - median: median value
   - mode:   location of the first maximum of the pdf
   - stdev: standard deviation
   - var: variance
   - scale: speading factor
   - entropy; shanon entropy
   - fischer; Fisher information
 - functional attributes
   - cdf; cumulative distribution function (always defined)
   - pdf; probability density function
   - invcdf; inverse of cdf
   - mgf; moment generating function
   - cf: characteristic function
   - confidence: confidence bounds on parameters

!!! WARNING
   Note that some of the attributes (not marked as always defined) are not available because they are undefined
   for the distribution used (as mean for the cauchy distribution) or currently still not implemented (for instance
   cf which is waiting for **EVE** complex implementation) or probably will never be implemented because no practical
   algorithm does exist.

Each constant attribute takes the distribution as input and returns a value or a set of values.

Each functionnal attribute (except confidence) takes the distribution and a
floating value as inputs and returns a floating value.

confidence takes 4 parameters

  - d the distribution
  - a floating value x where the cdf must be evaluated
  - the covariance matrix of the distribution parameters (considered as estimated) cov
  - a confidence alpha (0.05, specifies 100*(1-alpha)% confidence)

and return three values:

  - r the cdf of x
  - rlo lower confidence bound on r
  - rhi higher confidence bound on r


Note that some of the attributes (not marked as always defined) may not exist because they
are not defined for the distribution used or currently still not implemented (for instance cf
 which is waiting for **EVE** complex implementation ist still not present).
