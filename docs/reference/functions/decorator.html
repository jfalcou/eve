# Function Decorators

Decorators are higher-order functions that modify the behavior of other functions.
Every decorators returns a new callable object that will behave as the callable passed as
parameters but with different computation scheme (e.g more precision, more speed, etc...).

## Functions

**Convenience header:** <script type="preformatted">`#include <eve/function/decorators.hpp>`</script>

### Behavioral decorators
[`eve::numeric`](decorator/numeric.html)
:   makes the callable object computes its result without taking cares of NaNs if possible
[`eve::pedantic`](decorator/pedantic.html)
:   makes the callable object computes its result with additional corner case checks if possible
[`eve::raw`](decorator/raw.html)
:   makes the callable object computes its result with a simplified algorithm if possible
[`eve::regular`](decorator/regular.html)
:   makes the callable behaves normally
[`eve::saturated`](decorator/saturated.html)
:   makes the callable object computes its result while saturating its result

### Range restriction decorators
[`eve::restricted`](decorator/restricted.html)
:   makes the callable computes in a extremely reduce domain
[`eve::small`](decorator/small.html)
:   makes the callable computes in a greatly reduced domain
[`eve::medium`](decorator/medium.html)
:   makes the callable computes in a reduced domain
[`eve::big`](decorator/big.html)
:   makes the callable computes in the largest domain possible

### Conversion decorators

[`eve::float64`](decorator/double.html)
:   makes the callable automatically converts its result to `double`
[`eve::float32`](decorator/single.html)
:   makes the callable automatically converts its result to `float`
[`eve::int8`](decorator/int8.html)
:   makes the callable automatically converts its result to `std::int8_t`
[`eve::int16`](decorator/int16.html)
:   makes the callable automatically converts its result to `std::int16_t`
[`eve::int32`](decorator/int32.html)
:   makes the callable automatically converts its result to `std::int32_t`
[`eve::int64`](decorator/int64.html)
:   makes the callable automatically converts its result to `std::int64_t`
[`eve::uint8`](decorator/uint8.html)
:   makes the callable automatically converts its result to `std::uint8_t`
[`eve::uint16`](decorator/uint16.html)
:   makes the callable automatically converts its result to `std::uint16_t`
[`eve::uint32`](decorator/uint32.html)
:   makes the callable automatically converts its result to `std::uint32_t`
[`eve::uint64`](decorator/uint64.html)
:   makes the callable automatically converts its result to `std::uint64_t`
[`eve::to_`](decorator/to.html)
:   makes the callable automatically converts its result to an arbitrary type

### Rounding decorators

[`eve::downward`](decorator/downward.html)
:   makes the callable computes while performing rounding using the downward strategy
[`eve::upward`](decorator/upward.html)
:   makes the callable computes while performing rounding using the upward strategy
[`eve::to_nearest`](decorator/to_nearest.html)
:   makes the callable computes while performing rounding using the "to nearest" strategy
[`eve::toward_zero`](decorator/toward_zero.html)
:   makes the callable computes while performing rounding using the "toward zero" strategy
[`eve::tolerant`](decorator/tolerant.html)
:   makes the callable ulp tolerant around integral boundaries
