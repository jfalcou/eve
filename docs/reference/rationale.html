# Rationale

This section explains some our implementation choices.

  - [SIMD registers as Type x Cardinal](#rationale/simdregistersastypexcardinal)
  - [Function Objects as API](#rationale/functionobjectsasapi)
  - [Function customization via higher-order decorator](#rationale/functioncustomizationviahigher-orderdecorator)
  - [Masked operations support](#rationale/maskedoperationssupport)

## SIMD registers as Type x Cardinal
There is multiple way to abstract away SIMD registers. The choice made by **EVE** is to provide
a type interface based on the underlying **type** and **cardinal** (or number of elements). One can then
define a SIMD type by specifying:

  - Only the base type: `eve::wide<float>`. In this case, the best cardinal for the current architecture
    will be selected and will ensure optimal performance for the user.

  - The base type and cardinal: `eve::wide< float, eve::fixed< 8 > >`. This interface is more geared
    toward power users that may requires a specific cardinal for their algorithm on any architecture.
    In this case, **EVE** will take care of ensuring the semantic of such code is correct over any
    architecture.

This enables for SIMD code to be written in a complete architecture-agnostic way from the get go.

## Function Objects as API
The majority of **EVE** features is accessible as [Function Objects][func_obj]. Internally,
**EVE**'s implementation uses a simplified [Customization Point Object][cpo] design to achieve such goals.
This choice is driven by multiple reasons:

 - It makes all **EVE** "functions" directly usable as an argument to another function. Contrary to
   template functions, function objects can be easily passed as parameters to algorithms or other
   higher-order functions.

 - It enables the definition of [function decorators](#functioncustomizationviahigher-orderdecorator)
   that acts as lightweight wrapper for modifying the behavior of a function at compile-time.

 - It allows for a simplified API for [masked operations](#maskedoperationssupport) as the logical
   mask can be applied directly on the function object.

## Function customization via higher-order decorator
Decorators enable **EVE** functions to change behavior locally, enabling users to control their
choice of trade-off between speed, precision or any other design decision. Such decisions could also
have been implemented as functions in additional namespaces or functions with different names.

We decided against those options because:

  - extra namespaces may have required code duplication when combining multiple decorators or decorator
    and masking.

  - extra function names would have cluttered the API.

The use of callable object to modify another callable object also plays nicely with a purely
functional view of the library in which everything is a value, including function.

## Masked operations support
Some SIMD instruction sets provides intrinsics that can mask which lanes of the register are
affected by the operations. Those so-called **Masked operations** are accessible in **EVE** via the
following protocol:

  - Let `func` be an **EVE** object function object that supports masks and let `cond`
    be a [logical value](concepts.html#value).

  - Then, for any [value](concepts.html#value) `x`, the expression `func[cond](x, ...)`
    is equivalent to `if_else(cond, func_(x,...), x)`.

  - And, for any [value](concepts.html#value) `x`, the expression `func.not_[cond](x,...)`
    is equivalent to `if_else(!cond, func_(x,...), x)`. Note that the negation of the condition is
    not evaluated.

In these basic cases, if the mask is set to `false` for a given lane, the value returned by the function is the
corresponding value of `x`, regardless of other parameters. Note that this semantic implies that
`x` must be convertible to `decltype(func(x))`.

However note that masks also provide proper alternatives (rather than untouched output)  and even indexed selection allowing to treat only a vector part designation by indexes rather than values.
(see [the mask tutorial](../tutorial/masking.html) for more details).


The availability of such syntaxes is indicated explicitly in each function documentation page.
