# Extending EVE(1): adding a custom function implemented with intrinsics.

*NOTE: this documentation was valid at [commit](https://github.com/jfalcou/eve/tree/64d40a4034e536cfa78eab916ceb7c4e68190709).
The code samples are compiled but the text might get outdated.*<br/>
*NOTE: In order to be extensible, EVE exposes a lot of it's internals. However they are subject
to change even when the rest of the API is stable.*

## Intoduction

EVE like any other library of this nature is a collection of "tricks" implemented portably for different
architectures. However, what if EVE doesn't provide what you need?<br/>

1 - please create a feature request. <br/>
2 - since you need a solution now in this tutorial we are going to look at how to write your own
    functions that work with EVE.

We are going to see:
 * How to convert to register intrinsics and back.
 * How to require certain architecture for your function.

## Example problem

We are going to pick `first_true` function as an example. Let's say that we need it to implement
a variation on `std::find`. We are going to care about are all x86 from SSE2 to AVX2.

In this tutorial we are only supporting the very basic functionality.

## Starting simple

In most cases you probably want to keep your solution as simple as possible.
Let's say we just want EVE to generate certain intrinsics for 128 and 256 bit registers and that's it.

*NOTE: the main idea for the solution is: get a bit mask using `movemask` instruction family and then count trailing
bits to find the first one that's set.*<br/>
*NOTE: `first_true` can be implemented slightly better for types that are at least 4 bytes but that's not the point of this tutorial.*

Our first attempt could look something like

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c++
#include <bit>
#include <concepts>
#include <cstdint>
#include <optional>

#include <eve/wide.hpp>

template <eve::simd_value Wide>
std::uint32_t movemask(const eve::logical<Wide>& test) {
  using ABI = typename Wide::abi_type;

  if constexpr (std::same_as<ABI, eve::x86_128_>) {
    return _mm_movemask_epi8(test.storage());
  } else if constexpr (std::same_as<ABI, eve::x86_256_>) {
    if constexpr (eve::current_api == eve::avx) {
      __m128i lo = _mm256_extractf128_si256(test.storage(), 0);
      __m128i hi = _mm256_extractf128_si256(test.storage(), 1);
      std::uint32_t mmask = _mm_movemask_epi8(hi);
      mmask <<= 16;
      mmask |= _mm_movemask_epi8(lo);
      return mmask;
    } else if constexpr (eve::current_api == eve::avx2) {
      return _mm256_movemask_epi8(test.storage());
   }
  }
}

template <eve::simd_value Wide>
std::optional<std::uint32_t> first_true(const eve::logical<Wide>& test) {
  std::uint32_t mmask = movemask(test);

  if (!mmask) return std::nullopt;
  return std::countr_zero(mmask) / sizeof(eve::element_type_t<Wide>);
}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</script>

Let's break it down.

First we see `eve::simd_value` concept. This allows for anything that looks like `eve::wide`.
Alternatively we could've just used "`typename T, typename Size, typename ABI`".
Both of these are not sufficiently restrictive - we will deal with that in a bit.

`movemask` - is a function where we are actually going to do our intrinsics buisness.
We want 3 implementations: for sse 2-4.2, for avx and for avx2.
EVE provides two nobs to select which instruction set to use: ABI and API.
ABI is an indication of are you dealing with `__m128(i)` or `__m256(i)`. You can access ABI from the `wide::abi_type`.
Sometimes - it's enough - all instruction sets that support `128` bit registers support `_mm_movemask_epi8`.

However for `avx` and `avx2` we want to do different things: on `avx2` we have `_mm256_movemask_epi8` that
gives us what we want but on `avx` we have to split the register in 2. To understand which instruction set is
currently avaliable, we use `eve::current_api` accessor. <br/>
*NOTE: comparisons between apis are only defined within one architecture*.

As for the rest of `movemask` function - `.storage()` accessor returns you an underlying representaion from both
`eve::wide` and `eve::logical`. Both `eve::wide` and `eve::logical` are constructible from their underlying representation.
In our case it is just `__m128i` and `__m256i` depending on the size.

*NOTE: implicit conversions are also avaliable but I don't like them*.<br/>
*TODO: link to complete description of all storages for all platforms*.

## Being a better citizen

As I mentioned, we are not very good with our restrictions. If we try to compile for ARM let's say
or when AVX-512 support is in eve - we are likely to fail at the execution stage. We need better restrictions.

One thing we could do would look something like this.

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c++
#include <bit>
#include <concepts>
#include <cstdint>
#include <optional>

#include <eve/wide.hpp>

template <typename Wide, typename ABI>
  concept expected_wide_for_abi = std::same_as<
      Wide,
      eve::wide<eve::element_type_t<Wide>,
                eve::expected_cardinal_t<eve::element_type_t<Wide>, ABI>, ABI>>;

  template <typename Wide>
  concept supported_wide = expected_wide_for_abi<Wide, eve::x86_128_> ||
                           expected_wide_for_abi<Wide, eve::x86_256_>;

  template <supported_wide Wide>
  std::uint32_t movemask(const eve::logical<Wide>& test) requires(
      eve::current_api <= eve::avx2) {
...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</script>

The interesting part here is `eve::expected_cardinal_t` - this is a helper that tells you the default number of elements
in `eve::wide` for a given `ABI`. Example would be 8 `short` for `x86_128_` and 16 `short` for `x86_256_`.

With this I'd say we are done with the basic functionality.
You can support more things but I'd say they are in "implement when you actually need it" camp.

## Conclusion

Extensibility is absolutely a feature of eve. In other tutorials we'll have a look at how to support non-native
register sizes, conditionals and modifiers from EVE expressions language and how to generate function objects similar
to EVE's ones.
