                       **Expressive Vector Engine**

  (insert crumbs.html here)
![ ](logo.png width="150px") **EVE** is a reimplementation of the old **EVE** SIMD library by Falcou et al.
which for a while was named Boost.SIMD. It's a C++20 and onward implementation of a type based wrapper around
SIMD extensions sets for most current architectures. It aims at showing how C++20 can be used
to design and implement efficient, low level, high abstraction library suited for high performances.

It's a research project first and an open source library second. We reserve the right to
change API and baseline compiler required until the first official 0.1 release. However, we'll try
to minimize disruption. Semantic versioning will ensure API retro-compatibility if anything huge
needs to change.

# Current status - Advanced BETA

**EVE** is considered in **advanced beta**: it's usable, has an almost complete feature sets for a sensible amount of instructions sets but it's possible some values or performances issues may be possible. Don't hesitate to report any funky code-gen or bad optimizations so we can deliver the best performance around.

## Main remaining works:

  - Complete optimized implementations of multi-register shuffles
  - Reduction (sum, prod, etc) operations
  - Fix potential performance or codegen issues
  - Implement algorithms à la std over SIMD-izable ranges
  - Complete the documentations with bite-size tutorials

## Current roaster of supported Instructions Sets

  - **Intel**
    - SSE2, SSSE3, SSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2
    - AVX, AVX2, FMA4
  - **AMD**
    - XOP, FMA3
  - **PowerPC**
    - VMX
    - VSX
  - **ARM**
    - NEON (64 & 128 bits)
    - AARCH64

  - We **do not support** ARM SVE as the execution model makes no sense and the current compiler support is not adequate for us.
  - We **do not support** GPGPU, this is the job for another tool.

## Current roaster of supported compiler

**EVE** requires a C++ 20 compliant compiler. The main features from C++17/20 we require are:
 - Concepts and requires
 - Template lambdas
 - Inline variables
 - Non-Type Template Parameters
 - `if constexpr`
 - Functions from `<bits>`

Here is the current minimal compiler version supported:

| Compiler       | Version       |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| g++            | 10.2 or above |
| clang++        | 10   or above |
| Visual Studio  | *TBD*         |

Visual Studio support is currently being added. Help on the front of setting up appveyor properly is also welcome.

# FAQ

 - **Why C++20 ?** Because we want to be able to use modern design components like Concepts, and later on, Modules. C++14 is for 2014.
   We fully know it may hinders adoption in some situation, but we're not running a race. We value proper design and API choice over
   complex retro-compatibility.

 - **Why this instead of std::simd or any other libraries?** **EVE** is a playground for testing proper
   design and implementation decisions for such libraries. Vc and its standard version are fine pieces
   of work but we aim at pushing the envelop in term of API and implementation without any standard
   restriction. We will try, however, to keep up with standard naming as much as possible.

 - **Is this Boost.SIMD v42.69?** Yes and no. This reimplementation is based on slightly different
   premises and some radical new ideas. All results exhibited by all our previous Boost.SIMD papers
   still hold and we'll try to improve upon.

 - **I want to help!** Good, we need tests on exotic configuration, maybe a stable PPC test machine.
   Write code, make it fail so we can improve for use cases we may have missed. Fork and hack away.
   We would also value input (even harsh ones) on how we use our CI infrastructure or how our CMake looks.
   We tried our best but those elements are complex all by themselves.
